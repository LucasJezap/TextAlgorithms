They still went on and on. The rough path 
disappeared. The bushes, and the long 
grasses between the boulders, the patches of 
rabbit-cropped turf, the thyme and the sage and 
the marjoram, and the yellow rockroses all 
vanished, and they found themselves at the top 
of a wide steep slope of fallen stones, the 
remains of a landslide. When they began to go 
down this, rubbish and small pebbles rolled 
away from their feet; soon larger bits of split 
stone went clattering down and started other 
pieces below them slithering and rolling; then 



lumps of rock were disturbed and bounded off, 
crashing down with a dust and a noise. Before 
long the whole slope above them and below 
them seemed on the move, and they were 
sliding away, huddled all together, in a fearful 
confusion of slipping, rattling, cracking slabs 
and stones. 

It was the trees at the bottom that saved 
them. They slid into the edge of a climbing 
wood of pines that here stood right up the 
mountain slope from the deeper darker forests 
of the valleys below. Some caught hold of the 
trunks and swung themselves into lower 
branches, some (like the little hobbit) got 
behind a tree to shelter from the onslaught of 
the rocks. Soon the danger was over, the slide 
had stopped, and the last faint crashes could 
be heard as the largest of the disturbed stones 
went bounding and spinning among the 
bracken and the pine-roots far below. 

"Well! that has got us on a bit," said 
Gandalf; "and even goblins tracking us will have 
a job to come down here quietly." 

"I daresay," grumbled Bombur; "but they 
won't find it difficult to send stones bouncing 
down on our heads." The dwarves (and Bilbo) 
were feeling far from happy, and were rubbing 
their bruised and damaged legs and feet. 

"Nonsense! We are going to turn aside 
here out of the path of the slide. We must be 
quick! Look at the light!" 



The sun had long gone behind the 
mountains. Already the shadows were 
deepening about them, though far away through 
the trees and over the black tops of those 
growing lower down they could still see the 
evening lights on the plains beyond. They 
limped along now as fast as they were able 
down the gentle slopes of a pine forest in a 
slanting path leading steadily southwards. At 
times they were pushing through a sea of 
bracken with tall fronds rising right above the 
hobbit's head; at times they were marching 
along quiet as quiet over a floor of pine- 
needles; and all the while the forest-gloom got 
heavier and the forest-silence deeper. There 
was no wind that evening to bring even a sea- 
sighing into the branches of the trees. 


"Must we go any further?" asked Bilbo, when it 
was so dark that he could only just see Thorin's 
beard wagging beside him, and so quiet that he 
could hear the dwarves' breathing like a loud 
noise. "My toes are all bruised and bent, and 
my legs ache, and my stomach is wagging like 
an empty sack." 

"A bit further," said Gandalf. 

After what seemed ages further they came 
suddenly to an opening where no trees grew. 
The moon was up and was shining into the 
clearing. Somehow it struck all of them as not at 



all a nice place, although there was nothing 
wrong to see. 

All of a sudden they heard a howl away 
down hill, a long shuddering howl. It was 
answered by another away to the right and a 
good deal nearer to them; then by another not 
far away to the left. It was wolves howling at the 
moon, wolves gathering together! 

There were no wolves living near Mr. 
Baggins' hole at home, but he knew that noise. 
He had had it described to him often enough in 
tales. One of his elder cousins (on the Took 
side), who had been a great traveller, used to 
imitate it to frighten him. To hear it out in the 
forest under the moon was too much for Bilbo. 
Even magic rings are not much use against 
wolves - especially against the evil packs that 
lived under the shadow of the goblin-infested 
mountains, over the Edge of the Wild on the 
borders of the unknown. Wolves of that sort 
smell keener than goblins, and do not need to 
see you to catch you! 

"What shall we do, what shall we do!" he 
cried. "Escaping goblins to be caught by 
wolves!" he said, and it became a proverb, 
though we now say "out of the frying-pan into the 
fire" in the same sort of uncomfortable 
situations. 

"Up the trees quick!" cried Gandalf; and 
they ran to the trees at the edge of the glade, 
hunting for those that had branches fairly low, or 



were slender enough to swarm up. They found 
them as quick as ever they could, you can 
guess; and up they went as high as ever they 
could trust the branches. You would have 
laughed (from a safe distance), if you had seen 
the dwarves sitting up in the trees with their 
beards dangling down, like old gentlemen gone 
cracked and playing at being boys. Fili and Kili 
were at the top of a tall larch like an enormous 
Christmas tree. Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin, and Gloin 
were more comfortable in a huge pine with 
regular branches sticking out at intervals like 
the spokes of a wheel. Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, 
and Thorin were in another. Dwalin and Balin 
had swarmed up a tall slender fir with few 
branches and were trying to find a place to sit in 
the greenery of the topmost boughs. Gandalf, 
who was a good deal taller than the others, had 
found a tree into which they could not climb, a 
large pine standing at the very edge of the 
glade. He was quite hidden in its boughs, but 
you could see his eyes gleaming in the moon 
as he peeped out. 

And Bilbo? He could not get into any tree, 
and was scuttling about from trunk to trunk, like 
a rabbit that has lost its hole and has a dog 
after it. 

"You've left the burglar behind again!'' said 
Nori to Dori looking down. 

"I can't be always carrying burglars on my 
back," said Dori, "down tunnels and up trees! 



What do you think I am? A porter?" 

"He'll be eaten if we don't do something," 
said Thorin, for there were howls all round them 
now, getting nearer and nearer. "Dori!" he 
called, for Dori was lowest down in the easiest 
tree, "be quick, and give Mr. Baggins a hand 
up!" 

Dori was really a decent fellow in spite of 
his grumbling. Poor Bilbo could not reach his 
hand even when he climbed down to the bottom 
branch and hung his arm down as far as ever 
he could. So Dori actually climbed out of the 
tree and let Bilbo scramble up and stand on his 
back. 

Just at that moment the wolves trotted 
howling into the clearing. All of a sudden there 
were hundreds of eyes looking at them. Still 
Dori did not let Bilbo down. He waited till he 
had clambered off his shoulders into the 
branches, and then he jumped for the branches 
himself. Only just in time! A wolf snapped at his 
cloak as he swung up, and nearly got him. In a 
minute there was a whole pack of them yelping 
all round the tree and leaping up at the trunk, 
with eyes blazing and tongues hanging out. 

But even the wild Wargs (for so the evil 
wolves over the Edge of the Wild were named) 
cannot climb trees. For a time they were safe. 
Luckily it was warm and not windy. Trees are 
not very comfortable to sit in for long at any 
time; but in the cold and the wind, with wolves 



all round below waiting for you, they can be 
perfectly miserable places. 

This glade in the ring of trees was evidently 
a meeting-place of the wolves. More and more 
kept coming in. They left guards at the foot of 
the tree in which Dori and Bilbo were, and then 
went snuffling about till they had smelt out every 
tree that had anyone in it. These they guarded 
too, while all the rest (hundreds and hundreds it 
seemed) went and sat in a great circle in the 
glade; and in the middle of the circle was a 
great grey wolf. He spoke to them in the 
dreadful language of the Wargs. Gandalf 
understood it. Bilbo did not, but it sounded 
terrible to him, and as if all their talk was about 
cruel and wicked things, as it was. Every now 
and then all the Wargs in the circle would 
answer their grey chief all together, and their 
dreadful clamour almost made the hobbit fall 
out of his pine-tree. 

I will tell you what Gandalf heard, though 
Bilbo did not understand it. The Wargs and the 
goblins often helped one another in wicked 
deeds. Goblins do not usually venture very far 
from their mountains, unless they are driven out 
and are looking for new homes, or are 
marching to war (which I am glad to say has not 
happened for a long while). But in those days 
they sometimes used to go on raids, especially 
to get food or slaves to work for them. Then they 
often got the Wargs to help and shared the 



plunder with them. Sometimes they rode on 
wolves like men do on horses. Now it seemed 
that a great goblin-raid had been planned for 
that very night. The Wargs had come to meet 
the goblins and the goblins were late. The 
reason, no doubt, was the death of the Great 
Goblin, and all the excitement caused by the 
dwarves and Bilbo and the wizard, for whom 
they were probably still hunting. 

In spite of the dangers of this far land bold 
men had of late been making their way back 
into it from the South, cutting down trees, and 
building themselves places to live in among the 
more pleasant woods in the valleys and along 
the river-shores. There were many of them, and 
they were brave and well-armed, and even the 
Wargs dared not attack them if there were 
many together, or in the bright day. But now they 
had planned with the goblins' help to come by 
night upon some of the villages nearest the 
mountains. If their plan had been carried out, 
there would have been none left there next day; 
all would have been killed except the few the 
goblins kept from the wolves and carried back 
as prisoners to their caves. 

This was dreadful talk to listen to, not only 
because of the brave woodmen and their wives 
and children, but also because of the danger 
which now threatened Gandalf and his friends. 
The Wargs were angry and puzzled at finding 
them here in their very meeting-place. They 



thought they were friends of the woodmen, and 
were come to spy on them, and would take 
news of their plans down into the valleys, and 
then the goblins and the wolves would have to 
fight a terrible battle instead of capturing 
prisoners and devouring people waked 
suddenly from their sleep. So the Wargs had no 
intention of going away and letting the people 
up the trees escape, at any rate not until 
morning. And long before that, they said, goblin 
soldiers would be coming down from the 
mountains; and goblins can climb trees, or cut 
them down. 

Now you can understand why Gandalf, 
listening to their growling and yelping, began to 
be dreadfully afraid, wizard though he was, and 
to feel that they were in a very bad place, and 
had not yet escaped at all. All the same he was 
not going to let them have it all their own way, 
though he could not do very much stuck up in a 
tall tree with wolves all round on the ground 
below. He gathered the huge pine-cones from 
the branches of the tree. Then he set one alight 
with bright blue fire, and threw it whizzing down 
among the circle of the wolves. It struck one on 
the back, and immediately his shaggy coat 
caught fire, and he was leaping to and fro 
yelping horribly. Then another came and 
another, one in blue flames, one in red, another 
in green. They burst on the ground in the middle 
of the circle and went off in coloured sparks and 



smoke. A specially large one hit the chief wolf 
on the nose, and he leaped in the air ten feet, 
and then rushed round and round the circle 
biting and snapping even at the other wolves in 
his anger and fright. 

The dwarves and Bilbo shouted and 
cheered. The rage of the wolves was terrible to 
see, and the commotion they made filled all the 
forest. Wolves are afraid of fire at all times, but 
this was a most horrible and uncanny fire. If a 
spark got in their coats it stuck and burned into 
them, and unless they rolled over quick they 
were soon all in flames. Very soon all about the 
glade wolves were rolling over and over to put 
out the sparks on their backs, while those that 
were burning were running about howling and 
setting others alight, till their own friends chased 
them away and they fled off down the slopes 
crying and yammering and looking for water. 


"What is all this uproar in the forest tonight?" 
said the Lord of the Eagles. He was sitting, 
black in the moonlight, on the top of a lonely 
pinnacle of rock at the eastern edge of the 
mountains. "I hear wolves' voices! Are the 
goblins at mischief in the woods?" 

He swept up into the air, and immediately 
two of his guards from the rocks at either hand 
leaped up to follow him. They circled up in the 
sky and looked down upon the ring of the 



Wargs, a tiny spot far far below. But eagles 
have keen eyes and can see small things at a 
great distance. The Lord of the Eagles of the 
Misty Mountains had eyes that could look at the 
sun unblinking, and could see a rabbit moving 
on the ground a mile below even in the 
moonlight. So though he could not see the 
people in the trees, he could make out the 
commotion among the wolves and see the tiny 
flashes of fire, and hear the howling and yelping 
come up faint from far beneath him. Also he 
could see the glint of the moon on goblin spears 
and helmets, as long lines of the wicked folk 
crept down the hillsides from their gate and 
wound into the wood. 

Eagles are not kindly birds. Some are 
cowardly and cruel. But the ancient race of the 
northern mountains were the greatest of all 
birds; they were proud and strong and noble- 
hearted. They did not love goblins, or fear them. 
When they took any notice of them at all (which 
was seldom, for they did not eat such 
creatures), they swooped on them and drove 
them shrieking back to their caves, and 
stopped whatever wickedness they were doing. 
The goblins hated the eagles and feared them, 
but could not reach their lofty seats, or drive 
them from the mountains. 

Tonight the Lord of the Eagles was filled 
with curiosity to know what was afoot; so he 
summoned many other eagles to him, and they 



flew away from the mountains, and slowly 
circling ever round and round they came down, 
down, down towards the ring of the wolves and 
the meeting-place of the goblins. 

A very good thing too! Dreadful things had 
been going on down there. The wolves that had 
caught fire and fled into the forest had set it 
alight in several places, it was high summer, 
and on this eastern side of the mountains there 
had been little rain for some time. Yellowing 
bracken, fallen branches, deep-piled pine- 
needles, and here and there dead trees, were 
soon in flames. All round the clearing of the 
Wargs fire was leaping. But the wolf-guards did 
not leave the trees. Maddened and angry they 
were leaping and howling round the trunks, and 
cursing the dwarves in their horrible language, 
with their tongues hanging out, and their eyes 
shining as red and fierce as the flames. 

Then suddenly goblins came running up 
yelling. They thought a battle with the woodmen 
was going on; but they soon learned what had 
really happened. Some of them actually sat 
down and laughed. Others waved their spears 
and clashed the shafts against their shields. 
Goblins are not afraid of fire, and they soon had 
a plan which seemed to them most amusing. 

Some got all the wolves together in a pack. 
Some stacked fern and brushwood round the 
tree-trunks. Others rushed round and stamped 
and beat, and beat and stamped, until nearly all 



the flames were put out - but they did not put 
out the fire nearest to the trees where the 
dwarves were. That fire they fed with leaves and 
dead branches and bracken. Soon they had a 
ring of smoke and flame all round the dwarves, 
a ring which they kept from spreading outwards; 
but it closed slowly in, till the running fire was 
licking the fuel piled under the trees. Smoke 
was in Bilbo's eyes, he could feel the heat of 
the flames; and through the reek he could see 
the goblins dancing round and round in a circle 
like people round a midsummer bonfire. 
Outside the ring of dancing warriors with spears 
and axes stood the wolves at a respectful 
distance, watching and waiting. 

He could hear the goblins beginning a 
horrible song: 


Fifteen birds in five fir-trees, 

their feathers were fanned in a fiery 

breeze! 

But, funny little birds, they had no wings! 

O what shall we do with the funny little 
things? 

Roast 'em alive, orstewthem in a pot; 
fry them, boil them and eat them hot? 


Then they stopped and shouted out: "Fly 
away little birds! Fly away if you can! Come 
down little birds, or you will get roasted in your 



nests! Sing, sing little birds! Why don't you 
sing?" 

"Go away! little boys!" shouted Gandalf in 
answer. "It isn't bird-nesting time. Also naughty 
little boys that play with fire get punished." He 
said it to make them angry, and to show them 
he was not frightened of them - though of 
course he was, wizard though he was. But they 
took no notice, and they went on singing. 


Bum, bum tree and fern! 

Shrivel and scorch! A fizzling torch 
To light the night for our delight, 

Ya hey! 

Bake and toast 'em, fry and roast 'em! 
till beards blaze, and eyes glaze; 
till hair smells and skins crack, 
fat melts, and bones black 
in cinders lie 
beneath the sky! 

So dwarves shall die, 
and light the night for our delight, 

Ya hey! 

Ya-harri-hey! 

Ya hoy! 


And with that Ya hoy\ the flames were 
under Gandalf s tree. In a moment it spread to 
the others. The bark caught fire, the lower 



branches cracked. 

Then Gandalf climbed to the top of his tree. 
The sudden splendour flashed from his wand 
like lightning, as he got ready to spring down 
from on high right among the spears of the 
goblins. That would have been the end of him, 
though he would probably have killed many of 
them as he came hurtling down like a 
thunderbolt. But he never leaped. 

Just at that moment the Lord of the Eagles 
swept down from above, seized him in his 
talons, and was gone. 


There was a howl of anger and surprise from 
the goblins. Loud cried the Lord of the Eagles, 
to whom Gandalf had now spoken. Back swept 
the great birds that were with him, and down 
they came like huge black shadows. The 
wolves yammered and gnashed their teeth; the 
goblins yelled and stamped with rage, and flung 
their heavy spears in the air in vain. Over them 
swooped the eagles; the dark rush of their 
beating wings smote them to the floor or drove 
them far away; their talons tore at goblin faces. 
Other birds flew to the tree-tops and seized the 
dwarves, who were scrambling up now as far 
as they ever dared to go. 

Poor little Bilbo was very nearly left behind 
again! He just managed to catch hold of Dori's 
legs, as Dori was borne off last of all; and up 



they went together above the tumult and the 
burning, Bilbo swinging in the air with his arms 
nearly breaking. 

Now far below the goblins and the wolves 
were scattering far and wide in the woods. A 
few eagles were still circling and sweeping 
above the battleground. The flames about the 
trees sprang suddenly up above the highest 
branches. They went up in crackling fire. There 
was a sudden flurry of sparks and smoke. Bilbo 
had escaped only just in time! 

Soon the light of the burning was faint 
below, a red twinkle on the black floor; and they 
were high up in the sky, rising all the time in 
strong sweeping circles. Bilbo never forgot that 
flight, clinging onto Dori's ankles. He moaned 
"my arms, my arms!"; but Dori groaned "my 
poor legs, my poor legs!" 

At the best of times heights made Bilbo 
giddy. He used to turn queer if he looked over 
the edge of quite a little cliff; and he had never 
liked ladders, let alone trees (never having had 
to escape from wolves before). So you can 
imagine how his head swam now, when he 
looked down between his dangling toes and 
saw the dark lands opening wide underneath 
him, touched here and there with the light of the 
moon on a hill-side rock or a stream in the 
plains. 

The pale peaks of the mountains were 
coming nearer, moonlit spikes of rock sticking 



out of black shadows. Summer or not, it 
seemed very cold. He shut his eyes and 
wondered if he could hold on any longer. Then 
he imagined what would happen if he did not. 
He felt sick. 

The flight ended only just in time for him, just 
before his arms gave way. He loosed Dori's 
ankles with a gasp and fell onto the rough 
platform of an eagle's eyrie. There he lay 
without speaking, and his thoughts were a 
mixture of surprise at being saved from the fire, 
and fear lest he fall off that narrow place into the 
deep shadows on either side. He was feeling 
very queer indeed in his head by this time after 
the dreadful adventures of the last three days 
with next to nothing to eat, and he found himself 
saying aloud: "Now I know what a piece of 
bacon feels like when it is suddenly picked out 
of the pan on a fork and put back on the shelf!" 

"No you don't!" he heard Dori answering, 
"because the bacon knows that it will get back 
in the pan sooner or later; and it is to be hoped 
we shan't. Also eagles aren't forks!" 

"O no! Not a bit like storks - forks, I mean," 
said Bilbo sitting up and looking anxiously at 
the eagle who was perched close by. He 
wondered what other nonsense he had been 
saying, and if the eagle would think it rude. You 
ought not to be rude to an eagle, when you are 
only the size of a hobbit, and are up in his eyrie 
at night! 



The eagle only sharpened his beak on a 
stone and trimmed his feathers and took no 
notice. 

Soon another eagle flew up. "The Lord of 
the Eagles bids you to bring your prisoners to 
the Great Shelf," he cried and was off again. 
The other seized Dori in his claws and flew 
away with him into the night leaving Bilbo all 
alone. He had just strength to wonder what the 
messenger had meant by 'prisoners,' and to 
begin to think of being torn up for supper like a 
rabbit, when his own turn came. 

The eagle came back, seized him in his 
talons by the back of his coat, and swooped off. 
This time he flew only a short way. Very soon 
Bilbo was laid down, trembling with fear, on a 
wide shelf of rock on the mountain-side. There 
was no path down on to it save by flying; and no 
path down off it except by jumping over a 
precipice. There he found all the others sitting 
with their backs to the mountain wall. The Lord 
of the Eagles also was there and was speaking 
to Gandalf. 

It seemed that Bilbo was not going to be 
eaten after all. The wizard and the eagle-lord 
appeared to know one another slightly, and 
even to be on friendly terms. As a matter of fact 
Gandalf, who had often been in the mountains, 
had once rendered a service to the eagles and 
healed their lord from an arrow-wound. So you 
see 'prisoners' had meant 'prisoners rescued 



from the goblins' only, and not captives of the 
eagles. As Bilbo listened to the talk of Gandalf 
he realized that at last they were going to 
escape really and truly from the dreadful 
mountains. He was discussing plans with the 
Great Eagle for carrying the dwarves and 
himself and Bilbo far away and setting them 
down well on their journey across the plains 
below. 




The Misty Mountains looking West from the 
Eyrie towards Goblin Gate 


The Lord of the Eagles would not take them 
anywhere near where men lived. "They would 
shoot at us with their great bows of yew," he 
said, "for they would think we were after their 
sheep. And at other times they would be right. 
No! we are glad to cheat the goblins of their 
sport, and glad to repay our thanks to you, but 
we will not risk ourselves for dwarves in the 
southward plains." 

"Very well," said Gandalf. "Take us where 
and as far as you will! We are already deeply 
obliged to you. But in the meantime we are 
famished with hunger." 

"I am nearly dead of it," said Bilbo in a weak 
little voice that nobody heard. 

"That can perhaps be mended," said the 
Lord of the Eagles. 

Later on you might have seen a bright fire 
on the shelf of rock and the figures of the 
dwarves round it cooking and making a fine 
roasting smell. The eagles had brought up dry 
boughs for fuel, and they had brought rabbits, 
hares, and a small sheep. The dwarves 
managed all the preparations. Bilbo was too 
weak to help, and anyway he was not much 
good at skinning rabbits or cutting up meat, 
being used to having it delivered by the butcher 



all ready to cook. Gandalf, too, was lying down 
after doing his part in setting the fire going, 
since Oin and Gloin had lost their tinder-boxes. 
(Dwarves have never taken to matches even 
yet.) 

So ended the adventures of the Misty 
Mountains. Soon Bilbo's stomach was feeling 
full and comfortable again, and he felt he could 
sleep contentedly, though really he would have 
liked a loaf and butter better than bits of meat 
toasted on sticks. He slept curled up on the 
hard rock more soundly than ever he had done 
on his feather-bed in his own little hole at home. 
But all night he dreamed of his own house and 
wandered in his sleep into all his different 
rooms looking for something that he could not 
find nor remember what it looked like. 




Chapter VII 


QUEER LODGINGS 


The next morning Bilbo woke up with the early 
sun in his eyes. He jumped up to look at the 
time and to go and put his kettle on - and found 
he was not home at all. So he sat down and 
wished in vain for a wash and a brush. He did 
not get either, nor tea nor toast nor bacon for 
his breakfast, only cold mutton and rabbit. And 
after that he had to get ready for a fresh start. 

This time he was allowed to climb on to an 
eagle's back and cling between his wings. The 
air rushed over him and he shut his eyes. The 
dwarves were crying farewells and promising to 
repay the Lord of the Eagles if ever they could, 
as off rose fifteen great birds from the 
mountain's side. The sun was still close to the 
eastern edge of things. The morning was cool, 
and mists were in the valleys and hollows and 
twined here and there about the peaks and 
pinnacles of the hills. Bilbo opened an eye to 
peep and saw that the birds were already high 


up and the world was far away, and the 
mountains were falling back behind them into 
the distance. He shut his eyes again and held 
on tighter. 

"Don't pinch!" said his eagle. "You need not 
be frightened like a rabbit, even if you look 
rather like one. It is a fair morning with little 
wind. What is finer than flying?" 

Bilbo would have liked to say: "A warm bath 
and late breakfast on the lawn afterwards;" but 
he thought it better to say nothing at all, and to 
let go his clutch just a tiny bit. 

After a good while the eagles must have 
seen the point they were making for, even from 
their great height, for they began to go down 
circling round in great spirals. They did this for a 
long while, and at last the hobbit opened his 
eyes again. The earth was much nearer, and 
below them were trees that looked like oaks 
and elms, and wide grass lands, and a river 
running through it all. But cropping out of the 
ground, right in the path of the stream which 
looped itself about it, was a great rock, almost 
a hill of stone, like a last outpost of the distant 
mountains, or a huge piece cast miles into the 
plain by some giant among giants. 

Quickly now to the top of this rock the 
eagles swooped one by one and set down their 
passengers. 

"Farewell!" they cried, "wherever you fare, 



till your eyries receive you at the journey's end!" 
That is the polite thing to say among eagles. 

"May the wind under your wings bear you 
where the sun sails and the moon walks," 
answered Gandalf, who knew the correct reply. 

And so they parted. And though the Lord of 
the Eagles became in after days the King of All 
Birds and wore a golden crown, and his fifteen 
chieftains golden collars (made of the gold that 
the dwarves gave them), Bilbo never saw them 
again - except high and far off in the battle of 
Five Armies. But as that comes in at the end of 
this tale we will say no more about it just now. 

There was a flat space on the top of the hill 
of stone and a well worn path with many steps 
leading down it to the river, across which a ford 
of huge flat stones led to the grass-land beyond 
the stream. There was a little cave (a 
wholesome one with a pebbly floor) at the foot 
of the steps and near the end of the stony ford. 
Here the party gathered and discussed what 
was to be done. 

"I always meant to see you all safe (if 
possible) over the mountains," said the wizard, 
"and now by good management and good luck I 
have done it. Indeed we are now a good deal 
further east than I ever meant to come with you, 
for after all this is not my adventure. I may look 
in on it again before it is all over, but in the 
meanwhile I have some other pressing 



business to attend to." 

The dwarves groaned and looked most 
distressed, and Bilbo wept. They had begun to 
think Gandalf was going to come all the way 
and would always be there to help them out of 
difficulties. "I am not going to disappear this 
very instant," said he. "I can give you a day or 
two more. Probably I can help you out of your 
present plight, and I need a little help myself. 
We have no food, and no baggage, and no 
ponies to ride; and you don't know where you 
are. Now I can tell you that. You are still some 
miles north of the path which we should have 
been following, if we had not left the mountain 
pass in a hurry. Very few people live in these 
parts, unless they have come here since I was 
last down this way, which is some years ago. 
But there is somebody that I know of, who lives 
not far away. That Somebody made the steps 
on the great rock - the Carrock I believe he 
calls it. He does not come here often, certainly 
not in the daytime, and it is no good waiting for 
him. In fact it would be very dangerous. We 
must go and find him; and if all goes well at our 
meeting, I think I shall be off and wish you like 
the eagles 'farewell wherever you fare! ' " 

They begged him not to leave them. They 
offered him dragon-gold and silver and jewels, 
but he would not change his mind. "We shall 
see, we shall see!" he said, "and I think I have 



earned already some of your dragon-gold - 
when you have got it." 


After that they stopped pleading. Then they took 
off their clothes and bathed in the river, which 
was shallow and clear and stony at the ford. 
When they had dried in the sun, which was now 
strong and warm, they were refreshed, if still 
sore and a little hungry. Soon they crossed the 
ford (carrying the hobbit), and then began to 
march through the long green grass and down 
the lines of the wide-armed oaks and the tall 
elms. 

"And why is it called the Carrock?" asked 
Bilbo as he went along at the wizard's side. 

"He called it the Carrock, because carrock 
is his word for it. He calls things like that 
carrocks, and this one is the Carrock because 
it is the only one near his home and he knows it 
well." 

"Who calls it? Who knows it?" 

"The Somebody I spoke of - a very great 
person. You must all be very polite when I 
introduce you. I shall introduce you slowly, two 
by two, I think; and you must be careful not to 
annoy him, or heaven knows what will happen. 
He can be appalling when he is angry, though 
he is kind enough if humoured. Still I warn you 



he gets angry easily." 

The dwarves all gathered round when they 
heard the wizard talking like this to Bilbo. "Is 
that the person you are taking us to now?" they 
asked. "Couldn't you find someone more easy- 
tempered? Hadn't you better explain it all a bit 
clearer?" - and so on. 

"Yes it certainly is! No I could not! And I was 
explaining very carefully" answered the wizard 
crossly. "If you must know more, his name is 
Beorn. He is very strong, and he is a skin- 
changer." 

"What! a furrier, a man that calls rabbits 
conies, when he doesn't turn their skins into 
squirrels?" asked Bilbo. 

"Good gracious heavens, no, no, NO, NO!" 
said Gandalf. "Don't be a fool Mr. Baggins if 
you can help it; and in the name of all wonder 
don't mention the word furrier again as long as 
you are within a hundred miles of his house, nor 
rug, cape, tippet, muff, nor any other such 
unfortunate word! He is a skin-changer. He 
changes his skin: sometimes he is a huge 
black bear, sometimes he is a great strong 
black-haired man with huge arms and a great 
beard. I cannot tell you much more, though that 
ought to be enough. Some say that he is a bear 
descended from the great and ancient bears of 
the mountains that lived there before the giants 
came. Others say that he is a man descended 



from the first men who lived before Smaug or 
the other dragons came into this part of the 
world, and before the goblins came into the hills 
out of the North. I cannot say, though I fancy the 
last is the true tale. He is not the sort of person 
to ask questions of. 

"At any rate he is under no enchantment but 
his own. He lives in an oak-wood and has a 
great wooden house; and as a man he keeps 
cattle and horses which are nearly as 
marvellous as himself. They work for him and 
talk to him. He does not eat them; neither does 
he hunt or eat wild animals. He keeps hives and 
hives of great fierce bees, and lives most on 
cream and honey. As a bear he ranges far and 
wide. I once saw him sitting all alone on the top 
of the Carrock at night watching the moon 
sinking towards the Misty Mountains, and I 
heard him growl in the tongue of bears: The 
day will come when they will perish and I shall 
go back!' That is why I believe he once came 
from the mountains himself." 


Bilbo and the dwarves had now plenty to think 
about, and they asked no more questions. They 
still had a long way to walk before them. Up 
slope and down dale they plodded. It grew very 
hot. Sometimes they rested under the trees, 
and then Bilbo felt so hungry that he would have 



eaten acorns, if any had been ripe enough yet 
to have fallen to the ground. 

It was the middle of the afternoon before 
they noticed that great patches of flowers had 
begun to spring up, all the same kinds growing 
together as if they had been planted. Especially 
there was clover, waving patches of cockscomb 
clover, and purple clover, and wide stretches of 
short white sweet honey-smelling clover. There 
was a buzzing and a whirring and a droning in 
the air. Bees were busy everywhere. And such 
bees! Bilbo had never seen anything like them. 

"If one was to sting me," he thought, "I 
should swell up as big again as I am!" 

They were bigger than hornets. The drones 
were bigger than your thumb, a good deal, and 
the bands of yellow on their deep black bodies 
shone like fiery gold. 

"We are getting near," said Gandalf. "We 
are on the edge of his bee-pastures." 


After a while they came to a belt of tall and very 
ancient oaks, and beyond these to a high thorn- 
hedge through which you could neither see nor 
scramble. 

"You had better wait here," said the wizard 
to the dwarves; "and when I call or whistle begin 
to come after me - you will see the way I go - 



but only in pairs, mind, about five minutes 
between each pair of you. Bombur is fattest and 
will do for two, he had better come alone and 
last. Come on Mr. Baggins! There is a gate 
somewhere round this way." And with that he 
went off along the hedge taking the frightened 
hobbit with him. 

They soon came to a wooden gate, high 
and broad, beyond which they could see 
gardens and a cluster of low wooden buildings, 
some thatched and made of unshaped logs: 
barns, stables, sheds, and a long low wooden 
house. Inside on the southward side of the great 
hedge were rows and rows of hives with bell- 
shaped tops made of straw. The noise of the 
giant bees flying to and fro and crawling in and 
out filled all the air. 

The wizard and the hobbit pushed open the 
heavy creaking gate and went down a wide 
track towards the house. Some horses, very 
sleek and well-groomed, trotted up across the 
grass and looked at them intently with very 
intelligent faces; then off they galloped to the 
buildings. 

"They have gone to tell him of the arrival of 
strangers," said Gandalf. 

Soon they reached a courtyard, three walls 
of which were formed by the wooden house and 
its two long wings. In the middle there was lying 
a great oak-trunk with many lopped branches 



beside it. Standing near was a huge man with a 
thick black beard and hair, and great bare arms 
and legs with knotted muscles. He was clothed 
in a tunic of wool down to his knees, and was 
leaning on a large axe. The horses were 
standing by him with their noses at his shoulder. 

"Ugh! here they are!" he said to the horses. 
"They don't look dangerous. You can be off!" He 
laughed a great rolling laugh, put down his axe 
and came forward. 

"Who are you and what do you want?" he 
asked gruffly, standing in front of them and 
towering tall above Gandalf. As for Bilbo he 
could easily have trotted through his legs 
without ducking his head to miss the fringe of 
the man's brown tunic. 

"I am Gandalf," said the wizard. 

"Never heard of him," growled the man. 
"And what's this little fellow?" he said, stooping 
down to frown at the hobbit with his bushy black 
eyebrows. 

"That is Mr. Baggins, a hobbit of good 
family and unimpeachable reputation," said 
Gandalf. Bilbo bowed. He had no hat to take 
off, and was painfully conscious of his many 
missing buttons. "I am a wizard," continued 
Gandalf. "I have heard of you, if you have not 
heard of me; but perhaps you have heard of my 
good cousin Radagast who lives near the 
Southern borders of Mirkwood?" 



"Yes; not a bad fellow as wizards go, I 
believe. I used to see him now and again," said 
Beorn. "Well, now I know who you are, or who 
you say you are. What do you want?" 

"To tell you the truth, we have lost our 
luggage and nearly lost our way, and are rather 
in need of help, or at least of advice. I may say 
we have had rather a bad time with goblins in 
the mountains." 

"Goblins?" said the big man less gruffly. "O 
ho, so you've been having trouble with them 
have you? What did you go near them for?" 

"We did not mean to. They surprised us at 
night in a pass which we had to cross; we were 
coming out of the Lands over West into these 
countries - it is a long tale." 

"Then you had better come inside and tell 
me some of it, if it won't take all day," said the 
man leading the way through a dark door that 
opened out of the courtyard into the house. 

Following him they found themselves in a 
wide hall with a fire-place in the middle. Though 
it was summer there was a wood-fire burning 
and the smoke was rising to the blackened 
rafters in search of the way out through an 
opening in the roof. They passed through this 
dim hall, lit only by the fire and the hole above it, 
and came through another smaller door into a 
sort of veranda propped on wooden posts 
made of single tree-trunks. It faced south and 




was still warm and filled with the light of the 
westering sun which slanted into it, and fell 
golden on the garden full of flowers that came 
right up to the steps. 




foRo'smi 


Here they sat on wooden benches while 
Gandalf began his tale, and Bilbo swung his 
dangling legs and looked at the flowers in the 
garden, wondering what their names could be, 
as he had never seen half of them before. 

"I was coming over the mountains with a 
friend or two. . ." said the wizard. 

"Or two? I can only see one, and a little one 
at that," said Beorn. 

"Well to tell you the truth, I did not like to 
bother you with a lot of us, until I found out if you 
were busy. I will give a call, if I may." 

"Go on, call away!" 

So Gandalf gave a long shrill whistle, and 
presently Thorin and Dori came round the 
house by the garden path and stood bowing low 
before them. 

"One or three you meant, I see!" said Beorn. 
"But these aren't hobbits, they are dwarves!" 

"Thorin Oakenshield, at your service! Dori 
at your service!" said the two dwarves bowing 
again. 

"I don't need your service, thank you," said 


Beorn, "but I expect you need mine. I am not 
over fond of dwarves; but if it is true you are 
Thorin (son of Thrain, son of Thror, I believe), 
and that your companion is respectable, and 
that you are enemies of goblins and are not up 
to any mischief in my lands - what are you up 
to, by the way?" 

"They are on their way to visit the land of 
their fathers, away east beyond Mirkwood," put 
in Gandalf, "and it is entirely an accident that we 
are in your lands at all. We were crossing by the 
High Pass that should have brought us to the 
road that lies to the south of your country, when 
we were attacked by the evil goblins - as I was 
about to tell you." 

"Go on telling, then!" said Beorn, who was 
never very polite. 

"There was a terrible storm; the stone- 
giants were out hurling rocks, and at the head of 
the pass we took refuge in a cave, the hobbit 
and I and several of our companions. . ." 

"Do you call two several?" 

"Well, no. As a matter of fact there were 
more than two." 

"Where are they? Killed, eaten, gone 
home?" 

"Well, no. They don't seem all to have come 
when I whistled. Shy, I expect. You see, we are 
very much afraid that we are rather a lot for you 
to entertain." 



"Go on, whistle again! lam in for a party, it 
seems, and one or two more won't make much 
difference," growled Beorn. 

Gandalf whistled again; but Nori and Ori 
were there almost before he had stopped, for, if 
you remember, Gandalf had told them to come 
in pairs every five minutes. 

"Hullo!" said Beorn. "You came pretty quick 
- where were you hiding? Come on my jack-in- 
the-boxes!" 

"Nori at your service, Ori at. . ." they began; 
but Beorn interrupted them. 

"Thank you! When I want your help I will ask 
for it. Sit down, and let's get on with this tale, or 
it will be supper-time before it is ended." 

"As soon as we were asleep," went on 
Gandalf, "a crack at the back of the cave 
opened; goblins came out and grabbed the 
hobbit and the dwarves and our troop of ponies 

"Troop of ponies? What were you - a 
travelling circus? Or were you carrying lots of 
goods? Or do you always call six a troop?" 

"O no! As a matter of fact there were more 
than six ponies, for there were more than six of 
us - and well, here are two more!" Just at that 
moment Balin and Dwalin appeared and 
bowed so low that their beards swept the stone 
floor. The big man was frowning at first, but they 
did their best to be frightfully polite, and kept on 



nodding and bending and bowing and waving 
their hoods before their knees (in proper dwarf- 
fashion), till he stopped frowning and burst into 
a chuckling laugh: they looked so comical. 

"Troop, was right," he said. "A fine comic 
one. Come in my merry men, and what are your 
names? I don't want your service just now, only 
your names; and then sit down and stop 
wagging!" 

"Balin and Dwalin," they said not daring to 
be offended, and sat flop on the floor looking 
rather surprised. 

"Now go on again!" said Beorn to the 
wizard. 

"Where was I? O yes - I was not grabbed. I 
killed a goblin or two with a flash - " 

"Good!" growled Beorn. "It is some good 
being a wizard, then." 

" - and slipped inside the crack before it 
closed. I followed down into the main hall, which 
was crowded with goblins. The Great Goblin 
was there with thirty or forty armed guards. I 
thought to myself 'even if they were not all 
chained together, what can a dozen do against 
so many?'" 

"A dozen! That's the first time I've heard 
eight called a dozen. Or have you still got some 
more jacks that haven't yet come out of their 
boxes?" 

"Well, yes, there seem to be a couple more 



here now - Fili and Kili, I believe," said Gandalf, 
as these two now appeared and stood smiling 
and bowing. 

"That's enough!" said Beorn. "Sit down and 
be quiet! Now go on, Gandalf!" 

So Gandalf went on with the tale, until he 
came to the fight in the dark, the discovery of 
the lower gate, and their horror when they found 
that Mr. Baggins had been mislaid. "We 
counted ourselves and found that there was no 
hobbit. There were only fourteen of us left!" 

"Fourteen! That's the first time I've heard 
one from ten leave fourteen. You mean nine, or 
else you haven't told me yet all the names of 
your party." 

"Well, of course you haven't seen Oin and 
Gloin yet. And, bless me! here they are. I hope 
you will forgive them for bothering you." 

"O let 'em all come! Hurry up! Come along, 
you two, and sit down! But look here, Gandalf, 
even now we have only got yourself and ten 
dwarves and the hobbit that was lost. That only 
makes eleven (plus one mislaid) and not 
fourteen, unless wizards count differently to 
other people. But now please get on with the 
tale." Beorn did not show it more than he could 
help, but really he had begun to get very 
interested. You see, in the old days he had 
known the very part of the mountains that 
Gandalf was describing. He nodded and he 



growled, when he heard of the hobbit's 
reappearance and of their scramble down the 
stone-slide and of the wolf-ring in the woods. 

When Gandalf came to their climbing into 
trees with the wolves all underneath, he got up 
and strode about and muttered: "I wish I had 
been there! I would have given them more than 
fireworks!" 

"Well," said Gandalf very glad to see that 
his tale was making a good impression, "I did 
the best I could. There we were with the wolves 
going mad underneath us and the forest 
beginning to blaze in places, when the goblins 
came down from the hills and discovered us. 
They yelled with delight and sang songs making 
fun of us. Fifteen birds in live fir-trees . . 

"Good heavens!" growled Beorn. "Don't 
pretend that goblins can't count. They can. 
Twelve isn't fifteen and they know it." 

"And so do I. There were Bifur and Bofur as 
well. I haven't ventured to introduce them 
before, but here they are." 

In came Bifur and Bofur. "And me!" gasped 
Bombur puffing up behind. He was fat, and also 
angry at being left till last. He refused to wait 
five minutes, and followed immediately after the 
other two. 

"Well, now there are fifteen of you; and 
since goblins can count, I suppose that is all 
that there were up the trees. Now perhaps we 



can finish this story without any more 
interruptions." Mr. Baggins saw then how clever 
Gandalf had been. The interruptions had really 
made Beorn more interested in the story, and 
the story had kept him from sending the 
dwarves off at once like suspicious beggars. 
He never invited people into his house, if he 
could help it. He had very few friends and they 
lived a good way away; and he never invited 
more than a couple of these to his house at a 
time. Now he had got fifteen strangers sitting in 
his porch! 

By the time the wizard had finished his tale 
and had told of the eagles' rescue and of how 
they had all been brought to the Carrock, the 
sun had fallen behind the peaks of the Misty 
Mountains and the shadows were long in 
Beorn's garden. 

"Avery good tale!" said he. "The best I have 
heard for a long while. If all beggars could tell 
such a good one, they might find me kinder. 
You may be making it all up, of course, but you 
deserve a supper for the story all the same. 
Let's have something to eat!" 

"Yes please!" they all said together. "Thank 
you very much!" 


Inside the hall it was now quite dark. Beorn 
clapped his hands, and in trotted four beautiful 



white ponies and several large long-bodied 
grey dogs. Beorn said something to them in a 
queer language like animal noises turned into 
talk. They went out again and soon came back 
carrying torches in their mouths, which they lit at 
the fire and stuck in low brackets on the pillars 
of the hall about the central hearth. The dogs 
could stand on their hind-legs when they 
wished, and carry things with their fore-feet. 
Quickly they got out boards and trestles from 
the side walls and set them up near the fire. 

Then baa - baa - baa! was heard, and in 
came some snow-white sheep led by a large 
coal-black ram. One bore a white cloth 
embroidered at the edges with figures of 
animals; others bore on their broad backs trays 
with bowls and platters and knives and wooden 
spoons, which the dogs took and quickly laid on 
the trestle-tables. These were very low, low 
enough even for Bilbo to sit at comfortably. 
Beside them a pony pushed two low-seated 
benches with wide rush-bottoms and little short 
thick legs for Gandalf and Thorin, while at the 
far end he put Beorn's big black chair of the 
same sort (in which he sat with his great legs 
stuck far out under the table). These were all the 
chairs he had in his hall, and he probably had 
them low like the tables for the convenience of 
the wonderful animals that waited on him. What 
did the rest sit on? They were not forgotten. The 



other ponies came in rolling round drum- 
shaped sections of logs, smoothed and 
polished, and low enough even for Bilbo; so 
soon they were all seated at Beorn's table, and 
the hall had not seen such a gathering for many 
a year. 

There they had a supper, or a dinner, such 
as they had not had since they left the Last 
Homely House in the West and said good-bye 
to Elrond. The light of the torches and the fire 
flickered about them, and on the table were two 
tall red beeswax candles. All the time they ate, 
Beorn in his deep rolling voice told tales of the 
wild lands on this side of the mountains, and 
especially of the dark and dangerous wood, 
that lay outstretched far to North and South a 
day's ride before them, barring their way to the 
East, the terrible forest of Mirkwood. 

The dwarves listened and shook their 
beards, for they knew that they must soon 
venture into that forest and that after the 
mountains it was the worst of the perils they had 
to pass before they came to the dragon's 
stronghold. When dinner was over they began 
to tell tales of their own, but Beorn seemed to 
be growing drowsy and paid little heed to them. 
They spoke most of gold and silver and jewels 
and the making of things by smith-craft, and 
Beorn did not appear to care for such things: 
there were no things of gold or silver in his hall, 



and few save the knives were made of metal at 
all. 

They sat long at the table with their wooden 
drinking-bowls filled with mead. The dark night 
came on outside. The fires in the middle of the 
hall were built with fresh logs and the torches 
were put out, and still they sat in the light of the 
dancing flames with the pillars of the house 
standing tall behind them, and dark at the top 
like trees of the forest. Whether it was magic or 
not, it seemed to Bilbo that he heard a sound 
like wind in the branches stirring in the rafters, 
and the hoot of owls. Soon he began to nod 
with sleep and the voices seemed to grow far 
away, until he woke with a start. 

The great door had creaked and slammed. 
Beorn was gone. The dwarves were sitting 
cross-legged on the floor round the fire, and 
presently they began to sing. Some of the 
verses were like this, but there were many 
more, and their singing went on for a long while: 


The wind was on the withered heath, 
but in the forest stirred no leaf: 
there shadows lay by night and day, 
and dark things silent crept beneath. 



The wind came down from mountains 
cold, 

and like a tide it roared and rolled; 
the branches groaned, the forest moaned, 
and leaves were laid upon the mould. 


The wind went on from West to East; 
all movement in the forest ceased, 
but shrill and harsh across the marsh 
its whistling voices were released. 


The grasses hissed, their tassels bent, 
the reeds were rattling - on it went 
o'er shaken pool under heavens cool 
where racing clouds were tom and rent. 


It passed the lonely Mountain bare 
and swept above the dragon's lair: 
there black and dark lay boulders stark 
and flying smoke was in the air. 



It left the world and took its flight 
over the wide seas of the night. 

The moon set sail upon the gale, 
and stars were fanned to leaping light. 


Bilbo began to nod again. Suddenly up 
stood Gandalf. 

"It is time for us to sleep,'' he said, " - for us, 
but not I think for Beorn. In this hall we can rest 
sound and safe, but I warn you all not to forget 
what Beorn said before he left us: you must not 
stray outside until the sun is up, on your peril." 

Bilbo found that beds had already been laid 
at the side of the hall, on a sort of raised 
platform between the pillars and the outer wall. 
For him there was a little mattress of straw and 
woollen blankets. He snuggled into them very 
gladly, summertime though it was. The fire 
burned low and he fell asleep. Yet in the night 
he woke: the fire had now sunk to a few 
embers; the dwarves and Gandalf were all 
asleep, to judge by their breathing; a splash of 
white on the floor came from the high moon, 
which was peering down through the smoke- 
hole in the roof. 

There was a growling sound outside, and a 
noise as of some great animal scuffling at the 
door. Bilbo wondered what it was, and whether 
it could be Beorn in enchanted shape, and if he 



would come in as a bear and kill them. He 
dived under the blankets and hid his head, and 
fell asleep again at last in spite of his fears. 


It was full morning when he awoke. One of the 
dwarves had fallen over him in the shadows 
where he lay, and had rolled down with a bump 
from the platform on to the floor. It was Bofur, 
and he was grumbling about it, when Bilbo 
opened his eyes. 

"Get up lazybones," he said, "or there will be 
no breakfast left for you." 

Up jumped Bilbo. "Breakfast!" he cried. 
"Where is breakfast?" 

"Mostly inside us," answered the other 
dwarves who were moving about the hall; "but 
what is left is out on the veranda. We have been 
about looking for Beorn ever since the sun got 
up; but there is no sign of him anywhere, though 
we found breakfast laid as soon as we went 
out." 

"Where is Gandalf?" asked Bilbo, moving 
off to find something to eat as quick as he 
could. 

"O! out and about somewhere," they told 
him. But he saw no sign of the wizard all that 
day until the evening. Just before sunset he 
walked into the hall, where the hobbit and the 
dwarves were having supper, waited on by 



Beorn's wonderful animals, as they had been all 
day. Of Beorn they had seen and heard nothing 
since the night before, and they were getting 
puzzled. 

"Where is our host, and where have you 
been all day yourself?" they all cried. 

"One question at a time - and none till after 
supper! I haven't had a bite since breakfast." 

At last Gandalf pushed away his plate and 
jug - he had eaten two whole loaves (with 
masses of butter and honey and clotted cream) 
and drunk at least a quart of mead - and he 
took out his pipe. "I will answer the second 
question first," he said, " - but bless me! this is 
a splendid place for smoke rings!" Indeed for a 
long time they could get nothing more out of 
him, he was so busy sending smoke rings 
dodging round the pillars of the hall, changing 
them into all sorts of different shapes and 
colours, and setting them at last chasing one 
another out of the hole in the roof. They must 
have looked very queer from outside, popping 
out into the air one after another, green, blue, 
red, silver-grey, yellow, white; big ones, little 
ones; little ones dodging through big ones and 
joining into figure-eights, and going off like a 
flock of birds into the distance. 

"I have been picking out bear-tracks," he 
said at last. "There must have been a regular 
bears' meeting outside here last night. I soon 



saw that Beorn could not have made them all: 
there were far too many of them, and they were 
of various sizes too. I should say there were 
little bears, large bears, ordinary bears, and 
gigantic big bears, all dancing outside from 
dark to nearly dawn. They came from almost 
every direction, except from the west over the 
river, from the Mountains. In that direction only 
one set of footprints led - none coming, only 
ones going away from here. I followed these as 
far as the Carrock. There they disappeared into 
the river, but the water was too deep and strong 
beyond the rock for me to cross. It is easy 
enough, as you remember, to get from this bank 
to the Carrock by the ford, but on the other side 
is a cliff standing up from a swirling channel. I 
had to walk miles before I found a place where 
the river was wide and shallow enough for me 
to wade and swim, and then miles back again 
to pick up the tracks again. By that time it was 
too late for me to follow them far. They went 
straight off in the direction of the pine-woods on 
the east side of the Misty Mountains, where we 
had our pleasant little party with the Wargs the 
night before last. And now I think I have 
answered your first question, too," ended 
Gandalf, and he sat a long while silent. 

Bilbo thought he knew what the wizard 
meant. "What shall we do," he cried, "if he leads 
all the Wargs and the goblins down here? We 



shall all be caught and killed! I thought you said 
he was not a friend of theirs." 

"So I did. And don't be silly! You had better 
go to bed, your wits are sleepy." 

The hobbit felt quite crushed, and as there 
seemed nothing else to do he did go to bed; 
and while the dwarves were still singing songs 
he dropped asleep, still puzzling his little head 
about Beorn, till he dreamed a dream of 
hundreds of black bears dancing slow heavy 
dances round and round in the moonlight in the 
courtyard. Then he woke up when everyone 
else was asleep, and he heard the same 
scraping, scuffling, snuffling, and growling as 
before. 

Next morning they were all wakened by 
Beorn himself. "So here you all are still!" he 
said. He picked up the hobbit and laughed: "Not 
eaten up by Wargs or goblins or wicked bears 
yet I see"; and he poked Mr. Baggins' waistcoat 
most disrespectfully. "Little bunny is getting nice 
and fat again on bread and honey," he 
chuckled. "Come and have some more!" 

So they all went to breakfast with him. 
Beorn was most jolly for a change; indeed he 
seemed to be in a splendidly good humour and 
set them all laughing with his funny stories; nor 
did they have to wonder long where he had 
been or why he was so nice to them, for he told 
them himself. He had been over the river and 



right back up into the mountains - from which 
you can guess that he could travel quickly, in 
bear's shape at any rate. From the burnt wolf- 
glade he had soon found out that part of their 
story was true; but he had found more than that: 
he had caught a Warg and a goblin wandering 
in the woods. From these he had got news: the 
goblin patrols were still hunting with Wargs for 
the dwarves, and they were fiercely angry 
because of the death of the Great Goblin, and 
also because of the burning of the chief wolfs 
nose and the death from the wizard's fire of 
many of his chief servants. So much they told 
him when he forced them, but he guessed there 
was more wickedness than this afoot, and that 
a great raid of the whole goblin army with their 
wolf-allies into the lands shadowed by the 
mountains might soon be made to find the 
dwarves, or to take vengeance on the men and 
creatures that lived there, and who they thought 
must be sheltering them. 

"It was a good story, that of yours," said 
Beorn, "but I like it still better now I am sure it is 
true. You must forgive my not taking your word. 
If you lived near the edge of Mirkwood, you 
would take the word of no one that you did not 
know as well as your brother or better. As it is, I 
can only say that I have hurried home as fast as 
I could to see that you were safe, and to offer 
you any help that I can. I shall think more kindly 



of dwarves after this. Killed the Great Goblin, 
killed the Great Goblin!" he chuckled fiercely to 
himself. 

"What did you do with the goblin and the 
Warg?" asked Bilbo suddenly. 

"Come and see!" said Beorn, and they 
followed round the house. A goblin's head was 
stuck outside the gate and a warg-skin was 
nailed to a tree just beyond. Beorn was a fierce 
enemy. But now he was their friend, and 
Gandalf thought it wise to tell him their whole 
story and the reason of their journey, so that 
they could get the most help he could offer. 

This is what he promised to do for them. He 
would provide ponies for each of them, and a 
horse for Gandalf, for their journey to the forest, 
and he would lade them with food to last them 
for weeks with care, and packed so as to be as 
easy as possible to carry - nuts, flour, sealed 
jars of dried fruits, and red earthenware pots of 
honey, and twice-baked cakes that would keep 
good a long time, and on a little of which they 
could march far. The making of these was one 
of his secrets; but honey was in them, as in 
most of his foods, and they were good to eat, 
though they made one thirsty. Water, he said, 
they would not need to carry this side of the 
forest, for there were streams and springs 
along the road. "But your way through Mirkwood 
is dark, dangerous and difficult," he said. 



"Water is not easy to find there, nor food. The 
time is not yet come for nuts (though it may be 
past and gone indeed before you get to the 
other side), and nuts are about all that grows 
there fit for food; in there the wild things are 
dark, queer, and savage. I will provide you with 
skins for carrying water, and I will give you 
some bows and arrows. But I doubt very much 
whether anything you find in Mirkwood will be 
wholesome to eat or to drink. There is one 
stream there, I know, black and strong which 
crosses the path. That you should neither drink 
of, nor bathe in; for I have heard that it carries 
enchantment and a great drowsiness and 
forgetfulness. And in the dim shadows of that 
place I don't think you will shoot anything, 
wholesome or unwholesome, without straying 
from the path. That you MUST NOT do, for any 
reason. 

"That is all the advice I can give you. 
Beyond the edge of the forest I cannot help you 
much; you must depend on your luck and your 
courage and the food I send with you. At the 
gate of the forest I must ask you to send back 
my horse and my ponies. But I wish you all 
speed, and my house is open to you, if ever you 
come back this way again.'' 


They thanked him, of course, with many bows 



and sweepings of their hoods and with many an 
"at your service, O master of the wide wooden 
halls!" But their spirits sank at his grave words, 
and they all felt that the adventure was far more 
dangerous than they had thought, while all the 
time, even if they passed all the perils of the 
road, the dragon was waiting at the end. 

All that morning they were busy with 
preparations. Soon after midday they ate with 
Beorn for the last time, and after the meal they 
mounted the steeds he was lending them, and 
bidding him many farewells they rode off 
through his gate at a good pace. 

As soon as they left his high hedges at the 
east of his fenced lands they turned north and 
then bore to the north-west. By his advice they 
were no longer making for the main forest-road 
to the south of his land. Had they followed the 
pass, their path would have led them down a 
stream from the mountains that joined the great 
river miles south of the Carrock. At that point 
there was a deep ford which they might have 
passed, if they had still had their ponies, and 
beyond that a track led to the skirts of the wood 
and to the entrance of the old forest road. But 
Beorn had warned them that that way was now 
often used by the goblins, while the forest-road 
itself, he had heard, was overgrown and 
disused at the eastern end and led to 
impassable marshes where the paths had long 



been lost. Its eastern opening had also always 
been far to the south of the Lonely Mountain, 
and would have left them still with a long and 
difficult northward march when they got to the 
other side. North of the Carrock the edge of 
Mirkwood drew closer to the borders of the 
Great River, and though here the Mountains too 
drew down nearer, Beorn advised them to take 
this way; for at a place a few days' ride due 
north of the Carrock was the gate of a little- 
known pathway through Mirkwood that led 
almost straight towards the Lonely Mountain. 

"The goblins," Beorn had said, "will not dare 
to cross the Great River for a hundred miles 
north of the Carrock nor to come near my house 
- it is well protected at night! - but I should ride 
fast; for if they make their raid soon they will 
cross the river to the south and scour all the 
edge of the forest so as to cut you off, and 
Wargs run swifter than ponies. Still you are 
safer going north, even though you seem to be 
going back nearer to their strongholds; for that 
is what they will least expect, and they will have 
the longer ride to catch you. Be off now as quick 
as you may!" 

That is why they were now riding in silence, 
galloping wherever the ground was grassy and 
smooth, with the mountains dark on their left, 
and in the distance the line of the river with its 
trees drawing ever closer. The sun had only just 



turned west when they started, and till evening it 
lay golden on the land about them. It was 
difficult to think of pursuing goblins behind, and 
when they had put many miles between them 
and Beorn's house they began to talk and to 
sing again and to forget the dark forest-path 
that lay in front. But in the evening when the 
dusk came on and the peaks of the mountains 
glowered against the sunset they made a camp 
and set a guard, and most of them slept 
uneasily with dreams in which there came the 
howl of hunting wolves and the cries of goblins. 

Still the next morning dawned bright and fair 
again. There was an autumn-like mist white 
upon the ground and the air was chill, but soon 
the sun rose red in the East and the mists 
vanished, and while the shadows were still long 
they were off again. So they rode now for two 
more days, and all the while they saw nothing 
save grass and flowers and birds and scattered 
trees, and occasionally small herds of red deer 
browsing or sitting at noon in the shade. 
Sometimes Bilbo saw the horns of the harts 
sticking up out of the long grass, and at first he 
thought they were the dead branches of trees. 
That third evening they were so eager to press 
on, for Beorn had said that they should reach 
the forest-gate early on the fourth-day, that they 
rode still forward after dusk and into the night 
beneath the moon. As the light faded Bilbo 



thought he saw away to the right, or to the left, 
the shadowy form of a great bear prowling 
along in the same direction. But if he dared to 
mention it to Gandalf, the wizard only said: 
"Hush! Take no notice!" 

Next day they started before dawn, though 
their night had been short. As soon as it was 
light they could see the forest coming as it were 
to meet them, or waiting for them like a black 
and frowning wall before them. The land began 
to slope up and up, and it seemed to the hobbit 
that a silence began to draw in upon them. 
Birds began to sing less. There were no more 
deer; not even rabbits were to be seen. By the 
afternoon they had reached the eaves of 
Mirkwood, and were resting almost beneath the 
great overhanging boughs of its outer trees. 
Their trunks were huge and gnarled, their 
branches twisted, their leaves were dark and 
long. Ivy grew on them and trailed along the 
ground. 

"Well, here is Mirkwood!" said Gandalf. 
"The greatest of the forests of the Northern 
world. I hope you like the look of it. Now you 
must send back these excellent ponies you 
have borrowed." 

The dwarves were inclined to grumble at 
this, but the wizard told them they were fools. 
"Beorn is not as far off as you seem to think, 
and you had better keep your promises anyway, 



for he is a bad enemy. Mr. Baggins' eyes are 
sharper than yours, if you have not seen each 
night after dark a great bear going along with us 
or sitting far off in the moon watching our 
camps. Not only to guard you and guide you, 
but to keep an eye on the ponies too. Beorn 
may be your friend, but he loves his animals as 
his children. You do not guess what kindness he 
has shown you in letting dwarves ride them so 
far and so fast, nor what would happen to you, if 
you tried to take them into the forest." 

"What about the horse, then?" said Thorin. 
"You don't mention sending that back." 

"I don't, because I am not sending it." 

"What about your promise then?" 

"I will look after that. I am not sending the 
horse back, I am riding it!" 

Then they knew that Gandalf was going to 
leave them at the very edge of Mirkwood, and 
they were in despair. But nothing they could say 
would change his mind. 

"Now we had this all out before, when we 
landed on the Carrock," he said. "It is no use 
arguing. I have, as I told you, some pressing 
business away south; and I am already late 
through bothering with you people. We may 
meet again before all is over, and then again of 
course we may not. That depends on your luck 
and on your courage and sense; and I am 
sending Mr. Baggins with you. I have told you 



before that he has more about him than you 
guess, and you will find that out before long. So 
cheer up Bilbo and don't look so glum. Cheer 
up Thorin and Company! This is your expedition 
after all. Think of the treasure at the end, and 
forget the forest and the dragon, at any rate until 
tomorrow morning!" 

When tomorrow morning came he still said 
the same. So now there was nothing left to do 
but to fill their water-skins at a clear spring they 
found close to the forest-gate, and unpack the 
ponies. They distributed the packages as fairly 
as they could, though Bilbo thought his lot was 
wearisomely heavy, and did not at all like the 
idea of trudging for miles and miles with all that 
on his back. 

"Don't you worry!" said Thorin. "It will get 
lighter all too soon. Before long I expect we 
shall all wish our packs heavier, when the food 
begins to run short." 

Then at last they said good-bye to their 
ponies and turned their heads for home. Off 
they trotted gaily, seeming very glad to put their 
tails towards the shadow of Mirkwood. As they 
went away Bilbo could have sworn that a thing 
like a bear left the shadow of the trees and 
shambled off quickly after them. 

Now Gandalf too said farewell. Bilbo sat on 
the ground feeling very unhappy and wishing he 
was beside the wizard on his tall horse. He had 



gone just inside the forest after breakfast (a 
very poor one), and it had seemed as dark in 
there in the morning as at night, and very secret: 
"a sort of watching and waiting feeling," he said 
to himself. 

"Good-bye!" said Gandalf to Thorin. "And 
goodbye to you all, good-bye! Straight through 
the forest is your way now. Don't stray off the 
track! - if you do, it is a thousand to one you will 
never find it again and never get out of 
Mirkwood; and then I don't suppose I, or any 
one else, will ever see you again." 

"Do we really have to go through?" groaned 
the hobbit. 

"Yes, you do!" said the wizard, "if you want 
to get to the other side. You must either go 
through or give up your quest. And I am not 
going to allow you to back out now, Mr. 
Baggins. I am ashamed of you for thinking of it. 
You have got to look after all these dwarves for 
me," he laughed. 

"No! no!" said Bilbo. "I didn't mean that. I 
meant, is there no way round?" 

"There is, if you care to go two hundred 
miles or so out of your way north, and twice that 
south. But you wouldn't get a safe path even 
then. There are no safe paths in this part of the 
world. Remember you are over the Edge of the 
Wild now, and in for all sorts of fun wherever you 
go. Before you could get round Mirkwood in the 



North you would be right among the slopes of 
the Grey Mountains, and they are simply stiff 
with goblins, hobgoblins, and ores of the worst 
description. Before you could get round it in the 
South, you would get into the land of the 
Necromancer; and even you, Bilbo, won't need 
me to tell you tales of that black sorcerer. I don't 
advise you to go anywhere near the places 
overlooked by his dark tower! Stick to the 
forest-track, keep your spirits up, hope for the 
best, and with a tremendous slice of luck you 
may come out one day and see the Long 
Marshes lying below you, and beyond them, 
high in the East, the Lonely Mountain where 
dear old Smaug lives, though I hope he is not 
expecting you." 

"Very comforting you are to be sure," 
growled Thorin. "Good-bye! If you won't come 
with us, you had better get off without any more 
talk!" 

"Good-bye then, and really good-bye!" said 
Gandalf, and he turned his horse and rode 
down into the West. But he could not resist the 
temptation to have the last word. Before he had 
passed quite out of hearing he turned and put 
his hands to his mouth and called to them. They 
heard his voice come faintly: "Good-bye! Be 
good, take care of yourselves - and DON'T 
LEAVE THE PATH!" 

Then he galloped away and was soon lost 



to sight. "O good-bye and go away!" grunted the 
dwarves, all the more angry because they were 
really filled with dismay at losing him. Now 
began the most dangerous part of all the 
journey. They each shouldered the heavy pack 
and the water-skin which was their share, and 
turned from the light that lay on the lands 
outside and plunged into the forest. 




Chapter VIII 


FLIES AND SPIDERS 


They walked in single file. The entrance to the 
path was like a sort of arch leading into a 
gloomy tunnel made by two great trees that 
leant together, too old and strangled with ivy 
and hung with lichen to bear more than a few 
blackened leaves. The path itself was narrow 
and wound in and out among the trunks. Soon 
the light at the gate was like a little bright hole 
far behind, and the quiet was so deep that their 
feet seemed to thump along while all the trees 
leaned over them and listened. 

As their eyes became used to the dimness 
they could see a little way to either side in a sort 
of darkened green glimmer. Occasionally a 
slender beam of sun that had the luck to slip in 
through some opening in the leaves far above, 
and still more luck in not being caught in the 
tangled boughs and matted twigs beneath, 
stabbed down thin and bright before them. But 


this was seldom, and it soon ceased altogether. 

There were black squirrels in the wood. As 
Bilbo's sharp inquisitive eyes got used to 
seeing things he could catch glimpses of them 
whisking off the path and scuttling behind tree- 
trunks. There were queer noises too, grunts, 
scufflings, and hurryings in the undergrowth, and 
among the leaves that lay piled endlessly thick 
in places on the forest-floor; but what made the 
noises he could not see. The nastiest things 
they saw were the cobwebs: dark dense 
cobwebs with threads extraordinarily thick, 
often stretched from tree to tree, or tangled in 
the lower branches on either side of them. 
There were none stretched across the path, but 
whether because some magic kept it clear, or 
for what other reason they could not guess. 

It was not long before they grew to hate the 
forest as heartily as they had hated the tunnels 
of the goblins, and it seemed to offer even less 
hope of any ending. But they had to go on and 
on, long after they were sick for a sight of the 
sun and of the sky, and longed for the feel of 
wind on their faces. There was no movement of 
air down under the forest-roof, and it was 
everlastingly still and dark and stuffy. Even the 
dwarves felt it, who were used to tunnelling, and 
lived at times for long whiles without the light of 
the sun; but the hobbit, who liked holes to make 



a house in but not to spend summer days in, felt 
that he was being slowly suffocated. 

The nights were the worst. It then became 
pitch-dark - not what you call pitch-dark, but 
really pitch: so black that you really could see 
nothing. Bilbo tried flapping his hand in front of 
his nose, but he could not see it at all. Well, 
perhaps it is not true to say that they could see 
nothing: they could see eyes. They slept all 
closely huddled together, and took it in turns to 
watch; and when it was Bilbo's turn he would 
see gleams in the darkness round them, and 
sometimes pairs of yellow or red or green eyes 
would stare at him from a little distance, and 
then slowly fade and disappear and slowly 
shine out again in another place. And 
sometimes they would gleam down from the 
branches just above him; and that was most 
terrifying. But the eyes that he liked the least 
were horrible pale bulbous sort of eyes. "Insect 
eyes," he thought, "not animal eyes, only they 
are much too big." 

Although it was not yet very cold, they tried 
lighting watch-fires at night, but they soon gave 
that up. It seemed to bring hundreds and 
hundreds of eyes all round them, though the 
creatures, whatever they were, were careful 
never to let their bodies show in the little flicker 
of the flames. Worse still it brought thousands of 



dark-grey and black moths, some nearly as big 
as your hand, flapping and whirring round their 
ears. They could not stand that, nor the huge 
bats, black as a top-hat, either; so they gave up 
fires and sat at night and dozed in the 
enormous uncanny darkness. 

All this went on for what seemed to the 
hobbit ages upon ages; and he was always 
hungry, for they were extremely careful with their 
provisions. Even so, as days followed days, 
and still the forest seemed just the same, they 
began to get anxious. The food would not last 
for ever: it was in fact already beginning to get 
low. They tried shooting at the squirrels, and 
they wasted many arrows before they managed 
to bring one down on the path. But when they 
roasted it, it proved horrible to taste, and they 
shot no more squirrels. 

They were thirsty too, for they had none too 
much water, and in all the time they had seen 
neither spring nor stream. This was their state 
when one day they found their path blocked by 
a running water. It flowed fast and strong but not 
very wide right across the way, and it was 
black, or looked it in the gloom. It was well that 
Beorn had warned them against it, or they 
would have drunk from it, whatever its colour, 
and filled some of their emptied skins at its 
bank. As it was they only thought of how to 



cross it without wetting themselves in its water. 
There had been a bridge of wood across, but it 
had rotted and fallen leaving only the broken 
posts near the bank. 

Bilbo kneeling on the brink and peering 
forward cried: "There is a boat against the far 
bank! Now why couldn't it have been this side!" 

"How far away do you think it is?" asked 
Thorin, for by now they knew Bilbo had the 
sharpest eyes among them. 

"Not at all far. I shouldn't think above twelve 
yards." 

"Twelve yards! I should have thought it was 
thirty at least, but my eyes don't see as well as 
they used a hundred years ago. Still twelve 
yards is as good as a mile. We can't jump it, 
and we daren't try to wade or swim." 

"Can any of you throw a rope?" 

"What's the good of that? The boat is sure 
to be tied up, even if we could hook it, which I 
doubt." 

"I don't believe it is tied," said Bilbo, "though 
of course I can't be sure in this light; but it looks 
to me as if it was just drawn up on the bank, 
which is low just there where the path goes 
down into the water." 

"Dori is the strongest, but Fili is the 
youngest and still has the best sight," said 
Thorin. "Come here Fili, and see if you can see 



the boat Mr. Baggins is talking about." 

Fili thought he could; so when he had stared 
a long while to get an idea of the direction, the 
others brought him a rope. They had several 
with them, and on the end of the longest they 
fastened one of the large iron hooks they had 
used for catching their packs to the straps 
about their shoulders. Fili took this in his hand, 
balanced it for a moment, and then flung it 
across the stream. 

Splash it fell in the water! "Not far enough!" 
said Bilbo who was peering forward. "A couple 
of feet and you would have dropped it on to the 
boat. Try again. I don't suppose the magic is 
strong enough to hurt you, if you just touch a bit 
of wet rope." 

Fili picked up the hook when he had drawn 
it back, rather doubtfully all the same. This time 
he threw it with great strength. 

"Steady!" said Bilbo, "you have thrown it 
right into the wood on the other side now. Draw 
it back gently." Fili hauled the rope back slowly, 
and after a while Bilbo said: "Carefully! It is lying 
on the boat; let's hope the hook will catch." 

It did. The rope went taut, and Fili pulled in 
vain. Kili came to his help, and then Oin and 
Gloin. They tugged and tugged, and suddenly 
they all fell over on their backs. Bilbo was on the 
look out, however, caught the rope, and with a 



piece of stick fended off the little black boat as 
it came rushing across the stream. "Help!" he 
shouted, and Balin was just in time to seize the 
boat before it floated off down the current. 

"It was tied after all," said he, looking at the 
snapped painter that was still dangling from it. 
"That was a good pull, my lads; and a good job 
that our rope was the stronger." 

"Who'll cross first?" asked Bilbo. 

"I shall," said Thorin, "and you will come with 
me, and Fili and Balin. That's as many as the 
boat will hold at a time. After that Kili and Oin 
and Gloin and Dori; next Ori and Nori, Bifur and 
Bofur; and last Dwalin and Bombur." 

"I'm always last and I don't like it," said 
Bombur. "It's somebody else's turn today." 

"You should not be so fat. As you are, you 
must be with the last and lightest boatload. 
Don't start grumbling against orders, or 
something bad will happen to you." 

"There aren't any oars. How are you going 
to push the boat back to the far bank?" asked 
the hobbit. 

"Give me another length of rope and 
another hook," said Fili, and when they had got 
it ready, he cast it into the darkness ahead and 
as high as he could throw it. Since it did not fall 
down again, they saw that it must have stuck in 
the branches. "Get in now," said Fili, "and one 



of you haul on the rope that is stuck in a tree on 
the other side. One of the others must keep 
hold of the hook we used at first, and when we 
are safe on the other side he can hook it on, 
and you can draw the boat back." 

In this way they were all soon on the far 
bank safe across the enchanted stream. Dwalin 
had just scrambled out with the coiled rope on 
his arm, and Bombur (still grumbling) was 
getting ready to follow, when something bad did 
happen. There was a flying sound of hooves on 
the path ahead. Out of the gloom came 
suddenly the shape of a flying deer, it charged 
into the dwarves and bowled them over, then 
gathered itself for a leap. High it sprang and 
cleared the water with a mighty jump. But it did 
not reach the other side in safety. Thorin was 
the only one who had kept his feet and his wits. 
As soon as they had landed he had bent his 
bow and fitted an arrow in case any hidden 
guardian of the boat appeared. Now he sent a 
swift and sure shot into the leaping beast. As it 
reached the further bank it stumbled. The 
shadows swallowed it up, but they heard the 
sound of hooves quickly falter and then go still. 

Before they could shout in praise of the 
shot, however, a dreadful wail from Bilbo put all 
thoughts of venison out of their minds. "Bombur 
has fallen in! Bombur is drowning!" he cried. It 



was only too true. Bombur had only one foot on 
the land when the hart bore down on him, and 
sprang over him. He had stumbled, thrusting the 
boat away from the bank, and then toppled 
back into the dark water, his hands slipping off 
the slimy roots at the edge, while the boat span 
slowly off and disappeared. 

They could still see his hood above the 
water when they ran to the bank. Quickly, they 
flung a rope with a hook towards him. His hand 
caught it, and they pulled him to the shore. He 
was drenched from hair to boots, of course, but 
that was not the worst. When they laid him on 
the bank he was already fast asleep, with one 
hand clutching the rope so tight that they could 
not get it from his grasp; and fast asleep he 
remained in spite of all they could do. 

They were still standing over him, cursing 
their ill luck, and Bombur's clumsiness, and 
lamenting the loss of the boat which made it 
impossible for them to go back and look for the 
hart, when they became aware of the dim 
blowing of horns in the wood and the sound as 
of dogs baying far off. Then they all fell silent; 
and as they sat it seemed they could hear the 
noise of a great hunt going by to the north of the 
path, though they saw no sign of it. 

There they sat for a long while and did not 
dare to make a move. Bombur slept on with a 



smile on his fat face, as if he no longer cared 
for all the troubles that vexed them. Suddenly on 
the path ahead appeared some white deer, a 
hind and fawns as snowy white as the hart had 
been dark. They glimmered in the shadows. 
Before Thorin could cry out three of the dwarves 
had leaped to their feet and loosed off arrows 
from their bows. None seemed to find their 
mark. The deer turned and vanished in the trees 
as silently as they had come, and in vain the 
dwarves shot their arrows after them. 

"Stop! stop!" shouted Thorin; but it was too 
late, the excited dwarves had wasted their last 
arrows, and now the bows that Beorn had given 
them were useless. 

They were a gloomy party that night, and the 
gloom gathered still deeper on them in the 
following days. They had crossed the 
enchanted stream; but beyond it the path 
seemed to straggle on just as before, and in the 
forest they could see no change. Yet if they had 
known more about it and considered the 
meaning of the hunt and the white deer that had 
appeared upon their path, they would have 
known that they were at last drawing towards 
the eastern edge, and would soon have come, 
if they could have kept up their courage and 
their hope, to thinner trees and places where 
the sunlight came again. 



But they did not know this, and they were 
burdened with the heavy body of Bombur, which 
they had to carry along with them as best they 
could, taking the wearisome task in turns of four 
each while the others shared their packs. If 
these had not become all too light in the last few 
days, they would never have managed it; but a 
slumbering and smiling Bombur was a poor 
exchange for packs filled with food however 
heavy. In a few days a time came when there 
was practically nothing left to eat or to drink. 
Nothing wholesome could they see growing in 
the wood, only funguses and herbs with pale 
leaves and unpleasant smell. 

About four days from the enchanted stream 
they came to a part where most of the trees 
were beeches. They were at first inclined to be 
cheered by the change, for here there was no 
undergrowth and the shadow was not so deep. 
There was a greenish light about them, and in 
places they could see some distance to either 
side of the path. Yet the light only showed them 
endless lines of straight grey trunks like the 
pillars of some huge twilight hall. There was a 
breath of air and a noise of wind, but it had a 
sad sound. A few leaves came rustling down to 
remind them that outside autumn was coming 
on. Their feet ruffled among the dead leaves of 
countless other autumns that drifted over the 



banks of the path from the deep red carpets of 
the forest. 

Still Bombur slept and they grew very 
weary. At times they heard disquieting laughter. 
Sometimes there was singing in the distance 
too. The laughter was the laughter of fair voices 
not of goblins, and the singing was beautiful, but 
it sounded eerie and strange, and they were not 
comforted, rather they hurried on from those 
parts with what strength they had left. 

Two days later they found their path going 
downwards, and before long they were in a 
valley filled almost entirely with a mighty growth 
of oaks. 

"Is there no end to this accursed forest?" 
said Thorin. "Somebody must climb a tree and 
see if he can get his head above the roof and 
have a look round. The only way is to choose 
the tallest tree that overhangs the path." 

Of course "somebody" meant Bilbo. They 
chose him, because to be of any use the 
climber must get his head above the topmost 
leaves, and so he must be light enough for the 
highest and slenderest branches to bear him. 
Poor Mr. Baggins had never had much practice 
in climbing trees, but they hoisted him up into 
the lowest branches of an enormous oak that 
grew right out into the path, and up he had to go 
as best he could. He pushed his way through 



the tangled twigs with many a slap in the eye; 
he was greened and grimed from the old bark 
of the greater boughs; more than once he 
slipped and caught himself just in time; and at 
last, after a dreadful struggle in a difficult place 
where there seemed to be no convenient 
branches at all, he got near the top. All the time 
he was wondering whether there were spiders 
in the tree, and how he was going to get down 
again (except by falling). 

In the end he poked his head above the roof 
of leaves, and then he found spiders all right. 
But they were only small ones of ordinary size, 
and they were after the butterflies. Bilbo's eyes 
were nearly blinded by the light. He could hear 
the dwarves shouting up at him from far below, 
but he could not answer, only hold on and blink. 
The sun was shining brilliantly, and it was a long 
while before he could bear it. When he could, 
he saw all round him a sea of dark green, 
ruffled here and there by the breeze; and there 
were everywhere hundreds of butterflies. I 
expect they were a kind of "purple emperor", a 
butterfly that loves the tops of oak-woods, but 
these were not purple at all, they were a dark 
dark velvety black without any markings to be 
seen. 

He looked at the "black emperors" for a 
long time, and enjoyed the feel of the breeze in 



his hair and on his face; but at length the cries 
of the dwarves, who were now simply stamping 
with impatience down below, reminded him of 
his real business. It was no good. Gaze as 
much as he might, he could see no end to the 
trees and the leaves in any direction. His heart, 
that had been lightened by the sight of the sun 
and the feel of the wind, sank back into his toes: 
there was no food to go back to down below. 

Actually, as I have told you, they were not far 
off the edge of the forest; and if Bilbo had had 
the sense to see it, the tree that he had 
climbed, though it was tall in itself, was standing 
near the bottom of a wide valley, so that from its 
top the trees seemed to swell up all round like 
the edges of a great bowl, and he could not 
expect to see how far the forest lasted. Still he 
did not see this, and he climbed down full of 
despair. He got to the bottom again at last, 
scratched, hot, and miserable, and he could not 
see anything in the gloom below when he got 
there. His report soon made the others as 
miserable as he was. 

"The forest goes on for ever and ever and 
ever in all directions! Whatever shall we do? 
And what is the use of sending a hobbit!" they 
cried, as if it was his fault. They did not care 
tuppence about the butterflies, and were only 
made more angry when he told them of the 



beautiful breeze, which they were too heavy to 
climb up and feel. 


That night they ate their very last scraps and 
crumbs of food; and next morning when they 
woke the first thing they noticed was that they 
were still gnawingly hungry, and the next thing 
was that it was raining and that here and there 
the drip of it was dropping heavily on the forest 
floor. That only reminded them that they were 
also parchingly thirsty, without doing anything to 
relieve them: you cannot quench a terrible thirst 
by standing under giant oaks and waiting for a 
chance drip to fall on your tongue. The only 
scrap of comfort there was came unexpectedly 
from Bombur. 

He woke up suddenly and sat up scratching 
his head. He could not make out where he was 
at all, nor why he felt so hungry; for he had 
forgotten everything that had happened since 
they started their journey that May morning long 
ago. The last thing that he remembered was the 
party at the hobbit's house, and they had great 
difficulty in making him believe their tale of all 
the many adventures they had had since. 

When he heard that there was nothing to 
eat, he sat down and wept, for he felt very weak 



and wobbly in the legs. "Why ever did I wake 
up!" he cried. "I was having such beautiful 
dreams. I dreamed I was walking in a forest 
rather like this one, only lit with torches on the 
trees and lamps swinging from the branches 
and fires burning on the ground; and there was 
a great feast going on, going on for ever. A 
woodland king was there with a crown of 
leaves, and there was a merry singing, and I 
could not count or describe the things there 
were to eat and drink." 

"You need not try," said Thorin. "In fact if you 
can't talk about something else, you had better 
be silent. We are quite annoyed enough with 
you as it is. If you hadn't waked up, we should 
have left you to your idiotic dreams in the forest; 
you are no joke to carry even after weeks of 
short commons." 

There was nothing now to be done but to 
tighten the belts round their empty stomachs, 
and hoist their empty sacks and packs, and 
trudge along the track without any great hope of 
ever getting to the end before they lay down and 
died of starvation. This they did all that day, 
going very slowly and wearily; while Bombur 
kept on wailing that his legs would not carry him 
and that he wanted to lie down and sleep. 

"No you don't!" they said. "Let your legs 
take their share, we have carried you far 



enough." 

All the same he suddenly refused to go a 
step further and flung himself on the ground. "Go 
on, if you must," he said. "I'm just going to lie 
here and sleep and dream of food, if I can't get 
it any other way. I hope I never wake up again." 

At that very moment Balin, who was a little 
way ahead, called out: "What was that? I 
thought I saw a twinkle of light in the forest." 

They all looked, and a longish way off, it 
seemed, they saw a red twinkle in the dark; 
then another and another sprang out beside it. 
Even Bombur got up, and they hurried along 
then, not caring if it was trolls or goblins. The 
light was in front of them and to the left of the 
path, and when at last they had drawn level with 
it, it seemed plain that torches and fires were 
burning under the trees, but a good way off their 
track. 

"It looks as if my dreams were coming true," 
gasped Bombur puffing up behind. He wanted 
to rush straight off into the wood after the lights. 
But the others remembered only too well the 
warnings of the wizard and of Beorn. 

"A feast would be no good, if we never got 
back alive from it," said Thorin. 

"But without a feast we shan't remain alive 
much longer anyway," said Bombur, and Bilbo 
heartily agreed with him. They argued about it 



backwards and forwards for a long while, until 
they agreed at length to send out a couple of 
spies, to creep near the lights and find out more 
about them. But then they could not agree on 
who was to be sent: no one seemed anxious to 
run the chance of being lost and never finding 
his friends again. In the end, in spite of 
warnings, hunger decided them, because 
Bombur kept on describing all the good things 
that were being eaten, according to his dream, 
in the woodland feast; so they all left the path 
and plunged into the forest together. 

After a good deal of creeping and crawling 
they peered round the trunks and looked into a 
clearing where some trees had been felled and 
the ground levelled. There were many people 
there, elvish-looking folk, all dressed in green 
and brown and sitting on sawn rings of the 
felled trees in a great circle. There was a fire in 
their midst and there were torches fastened to 
some of the trees round about; but most 
splendid sight of all: they were eating and 
drinking and laughing merrily. 

The smell of the roast meats was so 
enchanting that, without waiting to consult one 
another, every one of them got up and 
scrambled forwards into the ring with the one 
idea of begging for some food. No sooner had 
the first stepped into the clearing than all the 



lights went out as if by magic. Somebody 
kicked the fire and it went up in rockets of 
glittering sparks and vanished. They were lost 
in a completely lightless dark and they could not 
even find one another, not for a long time at any 
rate. After blundering frantically in the gloom, 
falling over logs, bumping crash into trees, and 
shouting and calling till they must have waked 
everything in the forest for miles, at last they 
managed to gather themselves in a bundle and 
count themselves by touch. By that time they 
had, of course, quite forgotten in what direction 
the path lay, and they were all hopelessly lost, at 
least till morning. 

There was nothing for it but to settle down 
for the night where they were; they did not even 
dare to search on the ground for scraps of food 
for fear of becoming separated again. But they 
had not been lying long, and Bilbo was only just 
getting drowsy, when Dori, whose turn it was to 
watch first, said in a loud whisper:
